      <h1>About</h1>

<p>
    Online poker paid the bills for the past decade. More accurately, recreational mid-stakes pot-limit-omaha players paid graciously donated to slvrsluger – my online avatar. However, recently I moved to Philadelphia and have the silly idea stuck in my head to give live poker an honest go as a profession for the next few years.
</p>

<p>
    Needless to say, I have a lot to learn. This site is where my journey will be honestly captured as a journal, graphs, strategic ideas, and will serve as a tool for clarifying the inevitable pains of growing professionally.
</p>

<p>
    The recap of my years of being an online professional is quite mundane. Never overly ambitious, always scared of going broke, and constantly interested in things other than poker, my account balance never threatened zero nor hit six figures. I put in enough hours for the fish to pay all my bills. I studied enough to not get beaten-up by talented and dedicated mid-stakes professionals. I retired after periods of prolonged dedication and run-good, but I always came back.
</p>

<p>
    If those are the cliff-notes, the summary would have to be that the game has been good to me. While difficult at times, online plo has been stimulating, immensely educational (both emotionally and intellectually), has led me towards personal health, and given me a wonder-filled life surrounded by kind people.
</p>
<p>
    That said, a new adventure is here. I can only hope to use what I have learned so far to climb higher on the new slopes of Poker Mountain.
</p>

    I also keep a <a href='https://tedslocum.com'>daily personal blog</a>. Please get in touch I would love to hear from you readers. Contact me via email at sted9000@gmail.com.

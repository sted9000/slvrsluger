  <p>I’m old enough to have been around when the <em>revolutionary</em> idea that you should fold to some three-bets in six-max pot-limit-omaha came about. Revolution had two main tenants. One, Axxx hands did poorly enough against three-betting ranges to warrant a fold. And secondly, that some of the weakest one-way or none-nut hands you open such as raggy kings or the worst of the single suited rundowns couldn’t stand the heart either and should be folded.</p>

<p>To be quite honest my thinking has not become much more profound than those two points over the last handful of years. Today I reached the point where the little bit of curiosity and immense tiredness of not knowing what to do in this very common spot is leading to some action!</p>

<p>To limit the scope let’s only concern ourselves with optimal play at one rake level and only look at a four situations (small stakes rake; ep v bn, co v bn, bn v sb, co v bb). And before I set off searching for some answers I want to note my predictions - both as an exercise in masochistic imagination and scientific procedure. With that said let’s take a closer look at calling three-bets.</p>

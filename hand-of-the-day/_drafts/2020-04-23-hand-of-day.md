Here is a semi-common spot that I have no f&$king idea about and Vision might be able to help.

BNvMP, 3bp, 100bb, GG Poker

on a flop of:

Vision has BNvCO and BNvEP KQ4tt. Here IP is checking and betting @ 50% in both cases.

With this specific hand I am really unsure. It has a good blocker, but **hates** to be x/r. Vision says: With the naked Ah we are checking mostly. I suppose that we will need to balance this with a few Ahh hands too. Interesting.

And with all AA combos it is about 50/50. Choose wisely :)

Until tomorrow. Be well.

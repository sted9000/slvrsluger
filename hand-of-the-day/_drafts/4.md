This might not be the most practical analysis, but it is my blog and I am interested in cbet strategy when you flop bottom set on a one-straight mmm board. So let's take a look via Vision:

SBvBN, 3bp, holding:

On a flop of:

![card-image](/assets/cards/9H.svg#5cards)

The interaction of ranges with this board is very unique. Here is what I see:

- OP 3bettor is cbetting b33 half the time and checking the other half
- Mixing with AT77
- Turn it into AK77 and you are always checking

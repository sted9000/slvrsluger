OP: ch 11%; small 44%; pot 45%

IP vs Pot: fold 41%; call 59%

IP vs Small: fold 38%; call 11%; 51%

Interesting findings OP:

- AA is mixing betting small and potting
- J is betting small or checking
- The rare air is betting small or checking

Interesting findings IP vs Pot:

- Cutoff point seems to be KK w/ BDFD and A is a call

Interesting findings IP vs Small:

- Almost no calling
- Get-it-in with FD or J or the rare AA combo

Overall Learning is that OP is betting small quite often in order to be able to bluff small with his air.

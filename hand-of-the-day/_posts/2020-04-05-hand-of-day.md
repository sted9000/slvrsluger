So now I guess the two themes of this hand of the day blog are questions and gifts. Today we received a gift.

BB leads pot, I pot, MP folds and we get it in with BB who holds the second straight with no backup. Thank you.

Games have be amazing lately. Lots of gifts.

Hopefully soon these hands will be of more strategic value. Stick with me.

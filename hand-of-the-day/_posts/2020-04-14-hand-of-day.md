The idea is that the next 30 Hand of the Days will be of [Vision](https://www.runitonce.com/vision/) practice.

Situation: 100bb, 4bp, COvBN

This is the first rainbow board that I am exploring

OP: x 5%; bet pot 95%

IP vs Pot: fold 16%; call 84%

Wow this turned out to be a boring spot:

- OP bets all but top set and air
- IP calls all hands better than 55

And it turns out that the single-suited variation of this flop is no more interesting :(

OP: x 7%; bet pot 93%

IP vs Pot: fold 14%; call 86%

With pretty much the same type of distributions.

Going to teach my dog Frank this spot and when it comes up I will let him click the buttons.

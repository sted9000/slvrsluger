Check, half pot bet.

This is an unusual hand. I am not use to playing this deep (and neither are the others). So lets look at two aspects.
1. The preflop three-bet. What speculative AK hands (if any) is CO 3betting vs a MP open. Unfortunately we only have 100bb solutions, but we can try to infer from them.
2. The flop cbet strategy for IP (me)

Starting with preflop. Here are the AK strategies depending on suitedness:

![card-image](/assets/img/ak-ss-good.png)

![card-image](/assets/img/ak-ss-bad.png)

So here is what I see as fine heuristics: DS-Good is 3betting the best combos and flatting the worst ones. DS-Bad is 3betting the top third, flatting the middle third, and folding the bottom third. SS-Good is flatting the top half and folding the bottom half. And finally SS-Bad (suited to the K, not the A) is three-betting the top 10% and folding the rest.

Tomorrow we will look at the flop with Vision.

A question in two spots here pre and flop.

CO reg opens, we 3bet BN with

BB bad semi-reg flats, CO calls as well (3way). Flop of

Checks to us.

Pre - Gambit has this to say:

That makes sense to me. Hate to be 4b and get a lot of dominated hands to come along from the blinds.

Flop - I assume there is a class of hands that we will want to check-back. Maybe KKQx, AT98. So does this hand fit the bill? I think it might because we are 1 - Never getting better to fold 2 - Rarely getting worse to call 3 - Don't need much protection and 4 - Have a hand that can call turn stabs very comfortably.

That said protecting your hand in a spot where no-one will ever put in money bad is always the play.

Conclusion - Vs solid players, just bet small; vs splashy players, get fancy and check back.

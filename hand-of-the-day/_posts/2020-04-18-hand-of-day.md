This is pretty raggy as far as suited Axxx go. My predition is that it is still an open. This means that pretty much all A + Broadway combos are.

Wrong! And it is interesting that we are 3betting some of these hands.

So we are folding the combos where the third rank is 9,8,7- and not connected to fourth rank.

Until tomorrow. Be well.

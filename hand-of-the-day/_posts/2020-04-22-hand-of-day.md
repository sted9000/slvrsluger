Played a 4bp today that had me thinking "What would Vision do?"

MPvCO, 4bp, 100bb, GG Poker

on a flop of:

![card-image](/assets/cards/4D.svg#5cards)

My recollection and guess is that OP is shoving nearly 100% generally here and that this flop of MMLtt is included. Let's check vision. The closest spot they have is JT4tt COvBN. And yes OP is shoving 93% and AA32 (to remove the straight-draw) is shoving @ 100%.

Until tomorrow. Be well.

A break from [Vision](https://www.runitonce.com/vision/) practice.

Today's hand and concept is from a video by Richard Gryko.

BB v BN srp. Flop cbet-call. Turn ch-ch.

Board:

![card-image](/assets/cards/JH.svg#5cards)
![card-image](/assets/cards/9S.svg#5cards)
![card-image](/assets/cards/5H.svg#5cards)
![card-image](/assets/cards/QD.svg#5cards)
![card-image](/assets/cards/4S.svg#5cards)

The concept here is that the solver like a two bet-size strategy from OP on this river - 1/3p and 1p.

- Small bets allow us to bet more frequently(cheap bluffs and thin value)
- Large size punishes him for being capped

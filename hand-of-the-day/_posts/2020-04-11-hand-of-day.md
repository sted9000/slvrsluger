Situation: 100bb, 4bp, COvBN

This is a tricky one and I am still not sure what exactly is going.

OP: ch 74%; pot 26%

IP vs Pot: fold 13%; call 87%

IP vs Check: 27% check; small 17%; pot 56%

Interesting findings OP:

- Obviously OP is at a range disadvantage here and that is why he is checking at ton.
- Defending vs shove w/ 43% of AA combos after checking
- Also checking JT combos for balance.

Interesting findings IP vs Check:

- This is the more interesting decision point.
- Mixing a lot with his JT combos and I can't quite find the pattern yet.
- Betting small with hands that have no equity vs a shove such as AK75
- While potting with weak hands that have a enough equity vs OP calling ranges (AQ76bdfd)

Still a little lost, but have a better idea now :)

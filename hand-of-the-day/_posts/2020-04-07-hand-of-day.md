The pleasure of a new toy: **[Vision](https://www.runitonce.com/vision/)**. Let's take here out for a test drive.

COvBN, 100bb, SRP, Flop of:

![card-image](/assets/cards/AH.svg#5cards)

CO is going to bet quite often, right? **Wrong**. OOP is betting only 37%.

Let me make some predictions here and then tomorrow I will see how smart (or how full of myself) I am.

- Betting KK almost always, but less (around 75%) with AA.
- Betting NFD (also a pair) almost always, while checking most other FDs
- Betting the Good Axxx and Checking the Bad ones
- Betting most BDFD
- Most Kxxx
- xr of 15%, xf of 35%, xc of 50% from OOP
- IP defends by raising 5%, folding 40%, and calling 55%
- and IP bets when checked to 40%

Ooooh boy this toy is cool :)

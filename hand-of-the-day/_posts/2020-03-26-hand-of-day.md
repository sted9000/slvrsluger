So this hand I am not sold on my play, but I like the point that it illustrates.

MP we hold

EP Limps, we isolate, short button flats, sb regular flats, limper comes along to the flop (4way)

Sizing here is interesting, I chose small to keep in the class of hands _pair + draw_ of which I dominate most of. Only sb regular flats.

Sb bets 1/2 pot, we 3x that bet (one new-pots size bet, betting 1 to win 1, needs to work 1/2 the time to break even).

The idea is this: We do not have a hand that can call **and** we don't have any pure bluffs in our range (becasue we cbet the flop into 3 players, two of whom are recreational). In these spots I ask _is this player a decent hand reader and able to fold strong absolute hands_ if the answer is yes and yes, I consider going for it.

I am not sure about the math here: How often does he have QQ or TT that will never fold vs hands like a bare T or even other boats like QT that can consider folding. My intuition says that a lot of Txxx bets because vs the population at .5/1 it is murder not to. You get called by worse very often.

This time it worked. Tank.......fold.

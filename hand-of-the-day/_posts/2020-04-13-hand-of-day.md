A break from [Vision](https://www.runitonce.com/vision/) practice.

Today's hand and concept is from a video by Richard Gryko.

BB v BN 3bp, 100bb. Flop cbet 1/3p-call. Turn ch-ch.

BB Holdings:

The concept here is that the solver like a two bet-size strategy from OP on this river - 1/3p and 1p. Rather than the traditional large-bet or check strategy.

- OP gets to add 14% more bets whet using the top sizes
- OP has a good amount of sets and straights
- IP has a larger betting frequency when OP has _bet big or check_ strategy because OP has more bluff-catchers.
- OP's _bad bluffs_ don't want to bet large. B/c they are most often DS combo's w/o a flush-blocker.

Today my initial thoughts about OP and tomorrow we will continue to explore this spot as OP being the 3bettor looks to be more interesting and complex that when the 3bettor is IP.

OP Inicial Thoughts (checking 48; betting 52)

1. Looks like he is betting a lot of one pair + live card hands like QJT9, but checking the AKQJ. Still not sure why.
2. As we say in previous ss flops OP is checking Strong hands + NFD
3. Betting hands that have equity advantage now but are troublesome on turns: 9976, AQ65

The question for tomorrow is: What hands are checking and calling vs IP betting range? This makes up around 25% of our range than gets to the flop.

Until tomorrow...

I thought I would start of the _Hand of the Day_ series with a fun hand that illustrates a point that I have been thinking a lot about recently.

180bb deep with the fun player who straddles to 8bb on our direct left in the cutoff. Folds to us and we pot to 24bb with:

Fun player calls and we see the flop of

check, check

check, fun player bets 2/5 pot, we call

![card-image](/assets/cards/AC.svg#inline)

check, fun player bets 1/2 pot, we call and win.

The idea that I have been thinking a lot about is that as a small-stakes professional I am in large part just waiting for fun-players to make blunders and act predictably. In this case predictably continuing with 100%-range preflop and betting only a very narrow slice of that 100% for value on the river gives us an easy call with a hand that I would guess is well into the bottom 50th percentile of absolute hands.

It is not uplifting to realize that a large part of the job is waiting around for unaware gambling hobbyist to act like unaware gambling hobbyist. But what are you going to do. That is the job.

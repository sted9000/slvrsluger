This is a hand that I am unsure about. I will post my findings back here after a little study.

In BB. Reg opens ep, 50bb fun player min 3bets, another fun player on 50bb stack flats and folds to us with

First decision point that I am unsure of.

I pot to 23bbs and EP sticks in the 4bet, both fun players fold.

And we are at the second decision point.

While we can't get a concrete answer to the first question, we can to the second. My guess is that given an only AA range it is a fold, but change the range to 75% AA and 25% other reasonable 4betting hands and it is a call. Time to break out PPT (it has been a while).

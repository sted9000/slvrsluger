Check, half pot bet.

This is an unusual hand. I am not use to playing this deep (and neither are the others). So lets look at two aspects.
1. See [yesterdays post](https://slvrsluger.com/hand-of-the-day/2020/04/24/hand-of-day)
2. The flop cbet strategy for IP (me)

Today with the flop vis Vision (KQ4ss BNvCO 3bp):

- IP is Cbetting 50% and Half-potting the other 50%
- AK76 with the A flush blocker is betting 54% of the time
- Without a flush card in our hand we are checking 100%

Basically it is really mixed, but I believe the A flush blocker pushes us towards choosing a bet (to fold if raised) line.

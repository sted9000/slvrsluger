  <p>I intend to post a hand here everyday until the endtimes (I am writing this amid the COVID-19 pandemic, so that may be sooner rather than later). Some hands will highlight strategic aspects that I think are interesting. Some will be hands that I am unsure about. Some will shamelessly plug my training site <a href='https://gambitplo.com'>gambitPLO</a>. Some will be taken from poker forums. Maybe even some high-stakes hands for good fun.

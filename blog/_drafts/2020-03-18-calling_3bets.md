I'm old enough to have been around when the _revolutionary_ idea that you should fold to some three-bets in six-max pot-limit-omaha came about. Revolution had two main tenants. One, Axxx hands did poorly enough against three-betting ranges to warrant a fold. And secondly, that some of the weakest one-way or none-nut hands you open such as raggy kings or the worst of the single suited rundowns couldn't stand the heart either and should be folded.

To be quite honest my thinking has not become much more profound than those two points over the last handful of years. Today I reached the point where the little bit of curiosity and immense tiredness of not knowing what to do in this very common spot is leading to some action!

To limit the scope let's only concern ourselves with optimal play at one rake level and only look at a four situations (small stakes rake; ep v bn, co v bn, bn v sb, co v bb). And before I set off searching for some answers I want to note my predictions - both as an exercise in masochistic imagination and scientific procedure. With that said let's take a closer look at calling three-bets.

title: "Run It Once - A Reasonable Reason"
---

Over the years it has become more and more common for online sites and live players to offer to run it more than once (run-it-twice or RIT), meaning that players can agree to play out the remaining cards more than once after all the money is in and more cards are still to come. Also more and more common are ridiculous reasons for a player's decision to run-it-once or RIT. While I have heard many reasons, only a few are actually reasonable and almost none are logically sound. But I think I have a novel and reasonable reason to run-it-once and only once. (Note: I am aware that most people think their own reasons are reasonable, just hear me out).

In one word, attachment. Both the Buddha's teachings while wandering the kingdoms of India and Tommy Angelo's teachings in _Painless Poker_ agree that attachment is the source of much of our suffering and tilt (for more on that concept see Buddhism or Tommy Angelo). Simply, running-it-twice activates whatever module it is in our brain that has to do with attachment more than is necessary.

As professional gamblers we do not need the distractions that come along with attachment. Yes, while it is true that we are better at dealing with those distractions than are fun-players, we are not wholly immune to them either. Getting it it 60/40, running-it-twice, and splitting comes along with some flavor of _won the first one... that's good... mother fucker... almost scooped_. Rather you could have felt the pain or satisfaction (because we are non-enlightened creature and attached to the outcome, remember) only once and moved on to the next decision.

So my argument is really one of making better decisions. Because in the end that is what our job really is - we try to make the best decisions possible. I claim that less thoughts and feelings related to attachment is a way to do that.  

Conclusion, if you are enlightened (I know of only the Buddha and Tommy Angelo) run it twice and reduce variance; otherwise, run-it-once.
